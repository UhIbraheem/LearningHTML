            <pre>
                [Intro]
                High off life, yeah

                [Chorus]
                Seem like the life I fiend
                Seem like the life I fiend's a little distant, yeah
                Seems like the life I need, yeah
                Seems like the life I need's a little distant, yeah

                [Verse]
                Light the remedy, yeah
                Sit back while I ride the deep, do it on repeat, repeat
                Sins controlling me, yeah
                Angels, halos over me, I need blessings and my peace
                You been out the streets, yeah
                Wildin' on me and all my G's, we been going for a week
                Now you wanna peek, yeah
                Hands up, why they tryna reach? I can't even get that deep
                Told you, I don't teach (Yeah)
                Practice, oh, no, never preach
                Practice, oh, no, never preach
                Infiltrate the enemy, moving on them randomly

                [Chorus]
                Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
                Yeah
                Feels like the life I need, yeah
                Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
                Yeah, yeah, yeah
