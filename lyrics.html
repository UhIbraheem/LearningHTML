            [Intro]
            High off life, yeah

            [Chorus]
            Seem like the life I fiend
            Seem like the life I fiend's a little distant, yeah
            Seems like the life I need, yeah
            Seems like the life I need's a little distant, yeah

            [Verse]
            Light the remedy, yeah
            Sit back while I ride the deep, do it on repeat, repeat
            Sins controlling me, yeah
            Angels, halos over me, I need blessings and my peace
            You been out the streets, yeah
            Wildin' on me and all my G's, we been going for a week
            Now you wanna peek, yeah
            Hands up, why they tryna reach? I can't even get that deep
            Told you, I don't teach (Yeah)
            Practice, oh, no, never preach
            Practice, oh, no, never preach
            Infiltrate the enemy, moving on them randomly

            [Chorus]
            Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
            Yeah
            Feels like the life I need, yeah
            Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
            Yeah, yeah, yeah
